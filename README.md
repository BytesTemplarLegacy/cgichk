# cgichk
This is a VERY old command line tool for probing around websites looking for open directories. 

Generally used just for snooping around where you really _shouldn't_ be, or making sure your own sites aren't exposing anything unintentionally.

Cgichk is from a much older time. I barely remember anything about it, and I certainly don't recognize the code. 

Hell, I can't even remember if I wrote this from scratch back in the day, or if I modified someone elses code! 

How do you like that?! ;)
